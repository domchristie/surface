# Surface for monome

**Surface** is a MIDI control surface for monome.

Each column acts as a fader, and transmits MIDI CC messages (control number 77) on its assigned channel (between 1-8).

Set a value by pressing a button in the column. To _zero_ a fader, press the second-from-bottom button twice.

The bottom row is reserved for future channel strip functionality.
